/*
Wrap the code you've written in a function called loopyLighthouse(range, multiples, words) that you call with 3 parameters.

range should be an array of 2 numbers representing the start and end values for the loop.
multiples should be an array of 2 numbers representing the multiples you want to replace with words.
words should be an array of 2 strings representing the words that will replace the multiples.
For example, say we called the function with the following arguments.

loopyLighthouse([15, 90], [2, 5], ["Batty", "Beacon"]);
The loopyLighthouse function should log to the console all the numbers from 15 to 90, except replacing multiples of 2 with "Batty", multiples of 5 with "Beacon", and multiples of 2 and 5 with "BattyBeacon".
